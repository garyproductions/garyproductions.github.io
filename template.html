<!-- Created by garybracket on 06/24/2020 for all those Socom junkies who need their audio fixes.
	 This started as a solo project, but as I built it, I built it out into an organized template
	 so it can be re-used for more soundboards. Nothing exciting to see here.

	 Steam: garybracket
	 SVDL: garybracket
	 Socom: GaRy]
	 Discord: Send Message on Steam



v1.0 - Initial release.
v1.1 - Added looping sound effects.
v1.2 - Added navigation bar.
v1.3 - Added new page "Highlights"
v1.4 - Added new page "Home"
v1.5 - Restructured site a bit, added external style sheet to mass-edit site when the time comes.
