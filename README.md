# Dev environment of website hosted on no-illusion.com

Not a fullstack website, this will actually just serve as the preview area before changes are pushed to the home server. The eventual plan is to create a responsive site in a full stack architecture. 
Changes come here first to be previewed (static site), and if all goes well, the site is pushed to my server.
